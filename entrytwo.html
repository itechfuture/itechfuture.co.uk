      <h2>Entry 2 - Homelab Experiments</h2>
      <p>Introduction - A few years ago, I purchased the domain itechfuture.co.uk as a testing ground for web development. At the time, it felt like a random purchase, but it has since become a foundation for learning new IT skills.</p>
      
      <h2>Why GitHub?</h2>
      <p>
        I was looking for a free way to link an existing domain and host a static webpage. Since I already used GitHub for managing game development repositories, it felt natural to explore GitHub Pages. Learning to build a site using HTML on this platform seemed like a great opportunity to expand my skills.
      </p>

      <h2>Connecting DNS to GitHub Pages</h2>
      <p>
        Setting up the DNS was straightforward, thanks to GitHub’s setup instructions. I created a TXT record in my domain provider’s DNS manager to match GitHub’s provided value. Next, I added an A Name record to point to GitHub Pages' IP addresses. After completing these steps, I clicked "Verify DNS Server" on GitHub. A few minutes later, I received the confirmation: "DNS confirmed".
      </p>

      <h2>Setting Up Git</h2>
      <p>
        The second stage was more complex: configuring Git to sync my local files with the GitHub repository. I downloaded Git for Windows (v2.48.0). On my first attempt, I encountered issues in Visual Studio Code (VSC) due to incorrect installation settings. On my second try, I followed a detailed guide and adjusted the PATH environment by selecting "Git from the command line and 3rd-party software."
      </p>

      <h2>Generating an SSH Key</h2>
      <p>
        To authenticate my machine with GitHub, I generated an SSH key in the command prompt. After copying the key into GitHub’s SSH settings, I ensured secure authentication for all future repository updates.
      </p>

      <h2>Setting Up Visual Studio Code</h2>
      <p>
        To streamline my workflow, I configured Visual Studio Code as my code editor. I found this guide on YouTube particularly helpful for setting up Git integration with VSC. I plan to revisit it frequently as I familiarise myself with the workflow.

      <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
      <p>
        Lessonssssssssssssssssssss
      </p>      
      <p>
        As part of my learning journey, I’ll be posting this diary update and future updates about my development progress on the website I’ve created. This will serve as both a portfolio and a personal record of my growth in IT and web development.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moving forward, my next goal is to design and deploy a simple yet visually appealing web page using HTML and CSS, gradually adding more dynamic features over time.
