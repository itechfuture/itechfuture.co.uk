      <h2>Entry 3 - Python</h2>
      <p>This entry documents my early experiences learning the Python programming language</p>
      
      <h2>Why Python?</h2>
      <p>As a beginner in programming, I found that Python was the most recommended language in my research. It’s often suggested as a 
        first language because it’s known for being beginner friendly and easy to learn. Additionally, Python is widely used in various 
        fields, including data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
      </p>

      <h2>Start coding = start learning</h2>
      <p>
        There are several ways to start coding. Since I had already set up my homelab (as seen in my previous diary entry), I decided to 
        follow a YouTube guide to install Python 3 and IDLE (Integrated Development Environment). I also had the option to use Visual 
        Studio Code (VSC).
      </p>
      <p>After setting everything up, I found myself unsure of where to start. An episode of an IT career podcast I listened to 
        discussed effective learning strategies, emphasizing the benefits of structured courses with step-by-step lessons. This 
        approach worked well for both the host and guest, so I decided to explore online courses.
      </p>
      <p>After researching different platforms, I started a free trial on Codecademy (www.codecademy.com). Right away, I found it 
        to be highly effective. The lessons are well-structured, easy to follow, and include practical exercises. The built-in 
        coding environment allows you to write, run, and troubleshoot code directly within the lessons, making the learning process 
        much more interactive.
      </p>
      <p>Here’s how the lesson layout is structured
      </p>
      <p>Left: The Learn section introduces the topic and provides explanations</p>
      <p>Middle: This is the coding area, where you can add, remove, and edit strings and values</p>
      <p>Right: The output section displays the results when you run your code</p>
      <p>This setup makes it easy to learn, practice, and see immediate feedback.</p>
