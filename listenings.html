    <h1>Podcasts</h1>
    <h2>1. IT Career Podcast</h2>
      <p>This podcast is an excellent resource for anyone looking to transition into an IT career. The host, The 
        Bearded IT Dad, presents information in a clear and accessible way, making complex topics easy to understand.</p>
      <p>What makes this podcast especially inspiring is the host’s personal journey. Coming from a construction 
        background and working as a truck driver earning over $70K a year, he found his true passion in IT. Through 
        his interviews and discussions, he consistently encourages listeners to overcome their fears and take the leap 
        into the tech industry.</p>
      <p>The topics I’ve found particularly valuable include cybersecurity, networking, certification 
        roadmaps, and governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) both within and beyond the IT world.</p>

    <h2>3. The Shawn Ryan Show</h2>
    <p>I originally started watching SRS for its Everyday Carry (EDC) episodes, but occasionally, the channel features tech and IT-related guests. One of its most popular videos, with 8.5 million views, is an interview between host Shawn Ryan and ethical hacker Ryan Montgomery. Ryan is a penetration tester, hacker gadget creator, and one of the minds behind TryHackMe.com. Out of curiosity, I ran itechfuture.co.uk through the site and was pleased to see it passed the security check. TryHackMe is designed to educate users about cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities by exposing leaked data breaches across the web.</p>
    <p>I’d also recommend a recent episode featuring Mike Grover, a security researcher with a background in creating physical hacking tools and hardware implants. His work demonstrates how seemingly ordinary devices can be weaponized to monitor and steal information. This episode was eye-opening—it highlighted how almost any tech hardware can be compromised. Some shocking examples included a modified VGA cable that transmits screen activity to a hacker and a USB stick designed to self-destruct after stealing data from a machine.</p>
