    <h2>1. IT Career Podcast</h2>
      <p>This podcast is an excellent resource for anyone looking to transition into an IT career. The host, The 
        Bearded IT Dad, presents information in a clear and accessible way, making complex topics easy to understand.</p>
      <p>What makes this podcast especially inspiring is the host’s personal journey. Coming from a construction 
        background and working as a truck driver earning over $70K a year, he found his true passion in IT. Through 
        his interviews and discussions, he consistently encourages listeners to overcome their fears and take the leap 
        into the tech industry.</p>
      <p>The topics I’ve found particularly valuable include cybersecurity, networking, certification 
        roadmaps, and governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) both within and beyond the IT world.</p>

    <h2>3. The Shawn Ryan Show</h2>
    <p>SRS covers some strange concepts and themes the most popular video on the channel 8.5 million views features an interview with the host
      Shawn Ryan and guest Ryan Montgomery. Ryan is an ethical hacker, pentester. In addition he creates hacking gadgets and is one of the creators of tryhackme.com.
      The website is designed to make users aware of risks and vulnerabilities through breaches of data that are leaked onto the world wide web.</p>
    <p>I would also recommend one of the latest episodes released featuring Mike Grover, similar to Ryan mentioned above Mike goes by the title of security
      researcher and in his time has created many physcial hacking tools and gadgets like hardware implants that can hack and monitor visual and audio signals
      and send those signals back to a remote computer so that information is no longer private. This episode opened my eyes to the risks any tech hardware
    can be breached, some of the examples he showed ranged from a VGA cable that can send what you see on your screen back to the hacker and another showing a 
    USB stick that will explode once it has ripped all your data from your machine.</p>
