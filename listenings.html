    <h2>IT Career Podcast</h2>
    <p>This podcast is very informative and is always framed in a way that is easy to understand for people who are 
      interested in transitioning into an IT career. The host The Bearded I.T Dad is inspiring for me as he 
      mentions often in his interviews that he came from a construction background driving trucks for a living, making 
      good money over $70k a year but found his love and passion in I.T. His story and message during podcasts is always 
      to encourage listeners to overcome that fear of making the switch to an IT profession.</p>
